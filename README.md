# personal-website-template
This is a simple website template with a few icons of possible social media accounts you have.
I saw someone selling this thing for like 40$ so why not make it for free.
This website can have a video background you just neeed to enable it.
This website can also have music which you also just need to enable.
It also had a basic box-shadow animation (just so it doesnt look boring).
And feel free to change the template to whatever you want.
